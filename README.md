# Tokenizer

Tokenizer is an HTTP proxy that injects third party authentication credentials into requests. Clients encrypt third party secrets using the proxy's public key. When the client wants to send a request to the third party service, it does so via the proxy, sending along the encrypted secret in the `Proxy-Tokenizer` header. The proxy decrypts the secret and injects it into the client's request. To ensure that encrypted secrets can only be used by authorized clients, the encrypted data also includes instructions on authenticating the client.

Here's an example secret that the client encrypts using the proxy's public key:

```ruby
secret = {
    inject_processor: {
        token: "my-stripe-api-token"
    },
    bearer_auth: {
        digest: Digest::SHA256.base64digest('trustno1')
    }
}

seal_key = ENV["TOKENIZER_PUBLIC_KEY"]
sealed_secret = RbNaCl::Boxes::Sealed.new(seal_key).box(secret.to_json)
```

The client configures their HTTP library to use the tokenizer service as it's HTTP proxy:

```ruby
conn = Faraday.new(
    proxy: "http://tokenizer.flycast", 
    headers: {
        proxy_tokenizer: Base64.encode64(sealed_secret),
        proxy_authorization: "Bearer trustno1"
    }
)

conn.get("http://api.stripe.com")
```

The request will get rewritten to look like this:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: api.stripe.com
Authorization: Bearer my-stripe-api-token
```

Notice that the client's request is to _http_://api.stripe.com. In order for the proxy to be able to inject credentials into requests we need to speak plain HTTP to the proxy server, not HTTPS. The proxy transparently switches to HTTPS for connections to upstream services. This assumes communication between the client and tokenizer happens over a secure transport (a VPN).

## Processors

The processor dictates how the encrypted secret gets turned into a credential and added to the request. The example above uses `inject_processor`, which simply injects the verbatim secret into a request header. By default, this injects the secret into the `Authorization: Bearer` header without further processing. The `inject_processor` can optionally specify a destination and/or printf-style format string to be applied to the injection of the credential:

```ruby
secret = {
    inject_processor: {
        token: "my-stripe-api-token",
        dst:   "X-Stripe-Token",
        fmt:   "token=%s",
    },
    bearer_auth: {
        digest: Digest::SHA256.base64digest('trustno1')
    }
}
```

This will result in the header getting injected like this:

```http
X-Stripe-Token: token=my-stripe-api-key
```

Aside from `inject_processor`, we also have `inject_hmac_processor`. This creates an HMAC signatures using the key stored in the encrypted secret and injects that into a request header. The hash algorithm can be specified in the secret under the key `hash` and defaults to SHA256. This processor signs the verbatim request body by default, but can sign custom messages specified in the `msg` parameter in the `Proxy-Tokenizer` header (see about parameters bellow). This processor also respects the `dst` and `fmt` options.

```ruby
secret = {
    inject_hmac_processor: {
        key: "my signing key",
        hash: "sha256"
    },
    bearer_auth: {
        digest: Digest::SHA256.base64digest('trustno1')
    }
}
```

## Request-time parameters

If the destination/formatting might vary between requests, `inject_processor` and `inject_hmac_processor` can specify an allowlist of `dst`/`fmt` parameters that the client can specify at request time. These parameters are supplied as JSON in the `Proxy-Tokenizer` header after the encrypted secret.

```ruby
secret = {
    inject_processor: {
        token: "my-stripe-api-token"
        allowed_dst: ["X-Stripe-Token", "Authorization"],
        allowed_fmt: ["Bearer %s", "token=%s"],
    },
    bearer_auth: {
        digest: Digest::SHA256.base64digest('trustno1')
    }
}

seal_key = ENV["TOKENIZER_PUBLIC_KEY"]
sealed_secret = RbNaCl::Boxes::Sealed.new(seal_key).box(secret.to_json)

processor_params = {
    dst: "X-Stripe-Token", 
    fmt: "token=%s"
}

conn.headers[:proxy_tokenizer] = "#{Base64.encode64(sealed_secret)}; #{processor_params.to_json}"

conn.get("http://api.stripe.com")
```

## Host allowlist

If a client is fully compromised, the attacker could send encrypted secrets via tokenizer to a service that simply echoes back the request. This way, the attacker could learn the plaintext value of the secret. To mitigate against this, secrets can specify which hosts they may be used against. 

```ruby
secret = {
    inject_processor: {
        token: "my-stripe-api-token"
    },
    bearer_auth: {
        digest: Digest::SHA256.base64digest('trustno1')
    },
    allowed_hosts: ["api.stripe.com"],
    # or
    # allowed_host_pattern: ".*\.stripe\.com$"
}
```

## Production deployment — fly.io

Assuming you have [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) installed, start by cloning this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/superfly/tokenizer
cd ./tokenizer
```

create a fly.io app:

```shell
fly app create
export FLY_APP="<name of app>"
```

generate a private (open) key:

```shell
OPEN_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
fly secrets set --stage OPEN_KEY=$OPEN_KEY
```

Deploy the app without making it available on the internet<sup>1</sup>:

```shell
fly deploy --no-public-ips
```

Tokenizer is now deployed and accessible to other apps in your org at `<name of app>.flycast`. The deploy logs will contain the public (seal) key, which can be used for encrypting secrets.

<sup>1</sup>*Assigning a public IP address to the app is not recommended, since it will happily proxy traffic to private IP addresses. If you require a public deployment, consider running tokenizer in a separate, dedicated organization or using it in conjuction with [smokescreen](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen).*

## Production deployment — custom

Tokenizer is totally stateless, so it's simple to deploy anywhere.

Assuming you have Golang installed, you can build and install tokenizer in `/usr/local/bin` by running

```shell
GOBIN=/usr/local/bin go install github.com/superfly/tokenizer/cmd/tokenizer@latest
```

Generate a private (open) key:

```shell
export OPEN_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

Run the tokenizer server:

```shell
tokenizer
```

The output will contain the public (seal) key, which can be used for encrypting secrets.

## Test deployment

See the READMEs in `github.com/superfly/tokenizer/cmd/tokenizer` and `github.com/superfly/tokenizer/cmd/curl` for instructions on running/testing tokenizer locally.

## Configuration

Tokenizer is configured with the following environment variables:

- `OPEN_KEY` - The hex encoded 32 byte private key is used for decrypting secrets.
- `LISTEN_ADDRESS` - The address (`ip:port`) to listen on.
- `FILTERED_HEADERS` - A comma separated list of request headers to strip from client requests.
